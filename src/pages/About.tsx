        <h2>Hi, Iâ€™m Jasmine ðŸ‘‹</h2>
        <p>
          Iâ€™ve always been captivated by technology â€” from childhood hours spent exploring computer games to the moment I wrote my first line of code.
          Today, Iâ€™m a passionate computer science major focused on building digital experiences that make an impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          What draws me to this field isnâ€™t just the innovation â€” itâ€™s the opportunity to be a creator in a digital world. I aim to contribute meaningful software
          that moves us forward, whether itâ€™s through intuitive design, strong networking, or powerful logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technology surrounds us. My goal? To be at the heart of it â€” not just using it, but building it. Welcome to my digital showcase.
